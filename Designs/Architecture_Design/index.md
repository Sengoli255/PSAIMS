## Architecture Design
Architecture design is an early stage of system design process that represents the link between specifications and design process. It involves identifying major system components and their communication, determining the relationship that exists between them that will eventually help to make design decisions and documenting the results to be used in detailed design and documentation. Below are some of the significances of software architecture design

## Significances of documenting software architecture design
1. Stakeholder communication:
Architecture may be used as a focus of discussion by system stakeholders, it can be used as the basis for mutual understanding, negotiations, consensus and communication

2. Early design decisions:
Software architecture shows the earliest design decisions about a system,that will help accomplishing system development parts,deployment and it's maintenance life. It is also by far the earliest point at which design decisions governing the system to be built can be analyzed.

Software architecture design is most often represented using simple diagrams showing entities and their relationships. Use case diagrams are best used to accomplish this task.

## PSAIMS USE  CASE DIAGRAM
In our project a use case diagram simply represents the user's interaction with the system showing the relationship between the user and the use cases in which the user is involved, this helps to capture the dynamic behaviour of our system when it is running or operated.
